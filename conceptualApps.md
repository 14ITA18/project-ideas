### Conceptual Apps


Web apps that help students to understand an important or difficult topic/concept thoroughly.  
Here's an example - http://bracket.kgisl.com developed using the `elm` language. 

The repo is available over at https://www.github.com/kgashok/elmo-bracket

More such can be built.
