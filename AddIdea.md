### Add Idea to this repo 

How about a simple Web App (mobile app) to add an Idea to this repo? 

Right now, I use a http://j.mp/addidea (a shortener) to get this repo and add a file 
1. By giving a name
2. Editing some contents
3. Previewing the comments 
5. And then committing to the Github repo

### Additional improvisations

1. Provide a quick comparison to other ideas (like SO provides other questions)
2. Suggest a category in which to add 
3. Or select another idea which can be further enhanced by the current thought
4. Ability to upload an image to explain the idea, after all, a picture is worth a 1000 words
5. Indicate the difficulty level
