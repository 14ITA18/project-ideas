# Demo Application using GIFFEE

The move comes amid an enormous revolution sweeping information technology, 
one in which big-name companies and startups alike aim to recreate Borg for
the rest of the world. Alex Polvi, who runs one of these startups, CoreOS, 
describes the revolution with a hashtag: #GIFEE, or Google Infrastructure
For Everyone Elseâ€”which is even catchier. In addition to Mesosphere and CoreOS, 
a company called Docker is pushing this idea alongside the biggest names in 
cloud computing: Amazon, Microsoft, and, yes, Google.
